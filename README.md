Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by motor neuron (MN) degeneration, resulting in muscle weakness, spasticity, and paralysis. While previous studies have implicated neuroinflammation in ALS, the precise molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an integrated approach that combines single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing with spatial proteogenomics, we characterized both shared and distinct immune dynamics in peripheral blood and spinal cord tissues from sALS patients and fALS patients with C9orf72 repeat expansions. Our analysis revealed heightened activation of the innate immune complement system and altered clonally expanded T cells in the blood of ALS patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we localized complement-mediated inflammation and T cell infiltration to MN pathology in the ALS spinal cord. Together, these findings illuminate key molecular drivers of inflammation in ALS and present new therapeutic opportunities to mitigate inflammatory responses in the disease.
